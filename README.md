# Self_BalancingRobot

This repository contains a bare-metal self-balancing robot firmware for the STM32F407 Discovery board, implemented entirely at the register level (no HAL). It uses an MPU-6050 IMU (IÂ²C) to read 3-axis acceleration and gyro data, applies a complementary filter (100 Hz loop) to estimate pitch, and drives two DC motors via TIM3 PWM channels. A simple P-controller (configurable PID) maintains balance, with deadband and power limits to handle friction and safety. The code also supports on-the-fly calibration of sensor offsets, axis remapping for different chassis orientations, and a push-button start (EXTI on PA0) to enable the control loop. UART3 (PB10/PB11) at 9600 baud provides real-time telemetry (pitch, error, output) for tuning and debugging. Feel free to explore, tweak the PID gains or filter constants, and adapt it to your own balancing platform!
